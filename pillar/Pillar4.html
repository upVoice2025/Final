                    <div id="A1"><b>A</b>:&nbsp;We contact community partners who work with individuals with special needs and they identify candidates who have data entry/data management skills and product fulfillment skills. We also have a link on our website so that individuals may self-identify and apply directly to us.</div>

                    <div id="A2"><b>A</b>:&nbsp;We have an orientation as well as team building exercises as a part of the on-boarding process. We do on-the-job training for our employees. Our on-boarding process is about 4-6 weeks, depending on the employee. Every work day we begin with a morning meeting so that every employee knows what he or she will be focusing on that day. We often use visual supports as well as cross-checking to ensure accuracy of our employees' work. We provide ongoing feedback to make sure that employees know what is expected of them.</div>

                        <b>A</b>:&nbsp;- Know what your young person with special needs' strengths are and try to develop their strengths as much as possible. Look for opportunities for them to show what they can do such as volunteering in the community and/or internships that give them a sense of pride and accomplishment. <br>
                        - Give them responsibilities at home so that you have an opportunity to see their strengths and areas that need improvement. Remember to reinforce them for a job well done. <br>
                        - Encourage them to take responsibility for their self-care, being ready for school or activities on time, and following a weekly schedule.

                    <div id="A5"><b>A</b>:&nbsp;Perhaps the best way to promote an inclusive workforce is simply to experience it. When people see what excellent work individuals with special needs perform (their consistency, their pride in what they do, their attention to detail, their loyalty and dependability), they begin to see them as valued part of the team who are providing real value to the company.</div>
